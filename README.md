## 🧭 Project structure

- `public/` — static assets (index.html, icons, service-worker)
- `src/` — source files
  - `App.js` — root UI, footer
  - `index.js`, `index.css` — entry point & global styles
  - `components/` — `Header`, `TimerBox`, `TaskBox`, `ProgressBox`, etc.

---

## 🎨 Design & styling (keep it premium)

- Use CSS variables for a consistent design language (`--accent`, `--card`, `--muted`).
- Favor soft shadows, subtle gradients, and rounded corners for a modern, high-end feel.
- Keep typography spacious: larger line-height, modest font-size scale, and clear hierarchy.
- Reusable utilities: `.card`, `.btn-primary`, `.muted` — keep these in `index.css`.

Example starter variables (put in `index.css`):

```css
:root {
  --bg: #0f1724; /* dark neutral */
  --card: #ffffff;
  --accent: #7c5cff; /* luxe purple */
  --muted: #8b95a7;
  --glass: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06);
  --radius: 14px;
}
```

## ♻️ Reusability & accessibility notes

- Build tiny components with a single responsibility. Export and reuse them from `src/components`.
- Remove unknown or unnecessary `role` attributes — prefer semantic elements (button, header, footer).
- Add accessible labels only where required; keep interactive elements focus-visible and keyboard-accessible.

---

## 📦 Scripts

- `npm start` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — production bundle
- `npm test` — run tests (if configured)

---
